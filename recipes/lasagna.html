    <h1>Lasagne Recipe</h1>
    <h2> <img src="https://www.oliviascuisine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/4-cheese-lasagna.jpg" alt="Four Cheese Lasagna" width="200"></h2>
    <p> This Four Cheese Lasagna is a whole new beast! It is a cheese lover dreams come true! Layers of tender pasta, creamy sauce and not one, not two, but FOUR different cheeses. And it is much easier (and quicker) to make than my meat lasagna. </p>
    <h3>*     Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) package lasagna noodles, fresh or regular
        <li>    6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced></li>
        <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups whole milk, warm</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>A pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>8 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>4 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>4 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, grated</li>      
    </ul>
    <h3>*     Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the noodles until almost al dente (about 2 minutes less than what the package suggests). Drain and lay noodles on an oiled baking sheet. Reserve.</li>
        <li>To make the sauce: Heat the butter in a medium sauce pan, until melted. Add shallot and garlic, and sauté until fragrant and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add flour and stir or whisk quickly into the butter. Cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown – about 5 minutes. Slowly add the warm milk, loosening the roux while whisking constantly. Add bay leaf and nutmeg. Cook until starting to bubble and thicken. Remove bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and reserve.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce in a greased 13×9 inch baking dish. Layer 4 to 5 noodles lengthwise side by side, with edges overlapping. Top with a layer of béchamel and a layer of each cheese. Repeat for 2 more layers: pasta, sauce, cheese. Top the last layer of pasta with a generous amount of sauce and then a layer of cheese. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove foil, increase temperature to 400 degrees F and continue baking for another 15 minutes or until bubbly and golden brown. You can also pop it under the broiler to speed up the browning. Remove from oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting. Garnish if parsley or basil, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve! :)</li>
